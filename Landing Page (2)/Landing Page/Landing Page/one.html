                    <p>Established in 1873, Horlicks has been a trusted companion for families across generations. Our journey began with a vision to create a nutritious drink that would help people lead healthier lives. Over the years, we have stayed true to our commitment to quality and innovation, continually evolving to meet the changing needs of our consumers.Horlicks came to India with the British Army; the end of World War I saw Indian soldiers of British Indian Army bringing it back with them as a dietary supplement. Punjab, Bengal and Madras Presidencies became early adopters of Horlicks and many well-to-do Indians took to drinking Horlicks as a family drink in early 1940s and 1950s. It became a sort of status symbol in upper middle class Indians and rich classes. The first flavour available in India, as in Britain, was malt.

                      India, where it has traditionally been marketed as The Great Family Nourisher, is the largest market for Horlicks. The Indian formulation for Horlicks is slightly different from that used in most other countries, as there it is manufactured from buffalo milk rather than cows milk. In 2003, the brand underwent a revamp which led to the introduction of new flavours such as vanilla, toffee, chocolate, honey, and elaichi (cardamom). The current line-up of flavours include original (malt), chocolate and elaichi. with the latest offering Horlicks Kesar Badaam added recently to the portfolio, providing a more specialized taste offering to the consumers.
                      
                      In recent years, there has been an increase in the scope of the brand in India. By pushing it to newer segments of the market, Horlicks has become an umbrella brand for a wide variety of products ranging from the flagship malt drink to instant noodles, confectionery and breakfast cereal. Special formulations of the malted drink for young children (Junior Horlicks), breast-feeding mothers (Mother's Horlicks), women (Women's Horlicks) and adults (Lite Horlicks) exist. Horlicks biscuits were first launched in 1993, and an energy bar was launched in 2009, named Horlicks NutriBar. Also in late 2009, Foodles, a brand of instant noodles, was launched under the Horlicks umbrella. This was followed in 2011 by launches of Horlicks Gold, a premium variant of the malt drink (dubbed The Best Horlicks Ever), and Horlicks Oats, the first breakfast cereal product under the Horlicks brand</p>

        In my opinion Horlicks is best amongst all drinks I take in the morning at about 6.00 am.
This is my habit since I was released from Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in August 2020 after cancer operation on left cheek followed by Plastic surgery.
I had to tolerate "Radiation Therapy" in the hospital itself.
I was operated by Dr Suvadip Chakraborty, Onco-surgeon assisted by Dr Pawan Kumar.

        Got 1 kg of chocolate Horlicks at rupees 310 that is value for money, though the nutrition value is not not as good as Complan, but the Barley and wheat combination with chocolate flavour is not bad, the packaging was ordinary as they did not provide air bubble cushion pack with this Horlicks 1 kilo pack, the packaging should have been really better...
